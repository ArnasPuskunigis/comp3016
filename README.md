##Evaluation

I think that I have developed a great game whilst demonstrating my ability to write unmanaged code within the object-oriented paradigm.
I especially enjoyed the freedom of designing my own game while having strict deadlines, this forced me to design and develop efficiently where I have learnt of ways in which I could improve further.
Unfortunately, I did not add sound effects to this game, personally I do not care for sound in games which but I understand it is imporant to many.
I think that the visual designs are consistently beautiful and I enjoyed acquiring AI art and seeing how good it can look and how much easier it was than creating the art myself.
If I were to decide to work further on this project, I would consider adding more classes, power-ups, audio, and an improvement to the dice rolling system.
